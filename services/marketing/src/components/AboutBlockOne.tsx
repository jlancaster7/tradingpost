                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>
                    After working at hedge fund EJF Capital for six years as an Investment Analyst, Josh decided to
                    leave to pursue
                    a new goal. While he loved researching new investment ideas, something was missing. He always wanted
                    to build
                    something for people. And the hedge fund business didn't really allow him to do this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Josh was looking for new opportunities outside of the investment world, he still wanted to
                    continue to manage
                    his own money and keep up with the market. As he began exploring the many communities that have
                    grown and matured
                    on Twitter, YouTube, Substack, Reddit, etc, he saw that there was high quality research and analysis
                    being published
                    all over the internet. Self-made investment analysts and ex-Wall Street pros were having
                    conversations about every
                    sector and topic you could think of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, as is often the case on the internet, it was difficult and time consuming to
                    determine who was authoring
                    well-researched content and who was just trying to 'pump-and-dump' stocks for their own personal
                    gain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It has since become Josh's mission to build a platform that provides both creators and consumers of
                    investment content
                    with the tools and resources that are necessary for this amazing community to continue to thrive.
