<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:15.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:K2D;color:#666666'>Arbitration is more
informal than a lawsuit in court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration.
Instead, the dispute is resolve by a neutral arbitrator. Court review of an
arbitration award is limited. Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise,
arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You
agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
enforcement of this provision, and that you and Hivemind are each waiving the
right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration
provision will survive any termination of these Terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:15.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:K2D;color:#666666'>Any arbitration will be
administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules
including, if you are an individual, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for
Consumer-Related Disputes. If you are not an individual or have used the
Service on behalf of an entity, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for
Consumer-Related Disputes will not be used. The AAA’s rules are available at&nbsp;</span><span

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:15.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:K2D;color:#666666'>The number of
arbitrators will be one. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by
telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you
live or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted
in the English language. California law will apply. Judgment on the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:15.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:K2D;color:#666666'>Payment of all filing,
administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. If you
are an individual and have not accessed or used the Service on behalf of an
entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000,
unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek
attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the
claims are frivolous.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:15.0pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;font-family:K2D;color:#666666'>The arbitrator, and not
any federal, state, or local court, will have exclusive authority to resolve
any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability,
arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement,
including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void
or voidable. However, the preceding sentence will not apply to the “Class
Action Waiver” section below.</span></p>

brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff
or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiffs,
or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability
to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to
arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate
similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or
entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class
Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be
determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.
The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or
jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action,
is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through
arbitration.</span></p>

waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration
Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may
award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by
that party’s individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court
rather than in arbitration, you and Hivemind each waive any right to a jury
trial.</span></p>
