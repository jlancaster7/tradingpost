Expectation is 0.8% m/m, and May&#39;s reading came in at 0.8% as well. The release is at 8:30 am ET. A hot read (1% or more m/m) could be another risk off event, at least immediately after the print. Then Friday we do have OpEx and it is a big one.</p>&mdash; Markets &amp; Mayhem (@Mayhem4Markets) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mayhem4Markets/status/1547348451771424773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 13, 2022</a></blockquote>
